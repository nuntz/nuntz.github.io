Hi! I am Nicolas, I work as an IT leader in Fintech and I have over 20 year of experience in IT Operations and Software Development. I like working on challenging problems with global teams.

I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and also enjoy photography, reading, and hiking.

I don't post very often, but I am available on:
